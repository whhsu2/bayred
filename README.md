Help you make an informed real estate decision by showing extra data like nearby Natural Hazards and Crimes.
Homeluten is a feature-rich Chrome extension that makes your real estate search experience 100x better. No matter you are trying to buy or rent your next place, we help you make an informed real estate renting / buying decision by showing extra data on real estate websites like zillow.com, redfin.com and realtor.com. We do so by adding lots of additional enhancements like neighborhood information such as street view and local traffic data, noise level and crime map etc. to your regular Redfin, Zillow, Realtor website experience. It also highlights critical hazards like Superfunds so you can avoid those no-no homes before wasting time doing a comprehensive research. We've recently added neighborhood median income and ethnicity data to further help your real estate search.
